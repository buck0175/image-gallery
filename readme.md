I created my image gallery first using pure HTML and CSS to layout the images and elements exactly how I wanted them to look once I pushed them in using java script. Once I completed that process, then I erased all of the images but copied their structure over to my javascript file where I started to begin the process of pushing them in.

I created an array of objects to store my image data. This was the easiest method for me because I could access all of my images and their properties using image[i].propertyName and was able to loop through them that way. I then used an empty array to push all of my HTML in using template literals and joined the images to the screen.

I wanted to be creative with my design so I chose to have a left fixed sidebar which displays the website information while the images would scroll on the right.

I didn't really face too many problems during development. The only major issue I had to overcome was trying to get the image that was clicked on to be the image that showed up in the modal.

Overall, I learned a lot about javascript and the assignment was good practice. I also learned how to create modals, which I never knew how to do before this.
